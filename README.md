# DayZ_Server-Cfg_Files
A collection of specific server files, which I have changed.

Unfortunately, some files in the Steam DayZ workshop "Namalsk Overhaul" by Discord are outdated, which causes some minor issues with loot spawn.
I adapted the effected files, based on the regular version on Namalsk (not hardcore - may follow later).

I hope that helps others fixing issues with that realy nice workshop by Discord!
